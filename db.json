Similarly, the odd numbers are, in turn, numbers of the form \\(2n-1\\), again where \\(n\\) can be any positive integer, starting with \\(n=1\\).</p>\n<p>Here is a quick inductive proof that the sum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers is \\(n^2\\):</p>\n<p>Observe that \\((n-1)^2 + (2n-1) = n^2 \\).  Since \\(2n-1\\) is the \\(n^\\text{th}\\) odd number, if the statement is true for \\(n\\), it's now proven to also be true for \\(n+1\\).  Clearly, the statement holds true for \\(n=1\\), so that can be our base case.  And inductive reasoning takes over from there!</p>",
